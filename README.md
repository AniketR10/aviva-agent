# Agentic Chaser – AdvisoryAI Hackathon Challenge

Agentic Chaser is an intelligent dashboard designed for financial advisors to automate client chasing, track case progress, and generate AI-driven action scripts. It creates a timeline-based workflow to demonstrate agentic behavior in financial advisory contexts.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Active Case Dashboard

- **Real-time Table**  
  Displays a list of active client cases sorted by the most recent import or creation date.

- **Status Tracking**  
  Visual badges showing the latest completed action (e.g., _"Eligible for spousal ISA transfer"_) or a fallback **"No Activity"** status.

- **Search & Filter**  
  A search bar that allows advisors to quickly find cases by **Client Name**, enabling fast access in large datasets.

- **Dynamic Columns**
  - Client Name & Client ID badges  
  - Latest Action with AI-cleaned text (removes technical prefixes)  
  - Last Update time using real-world relative time (e.g., _"less than a minute ago"_)

- **Case Management**  
  Trash button to delete cases directly from the table row.
